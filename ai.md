AI Instructions

AI should:

1. Write its progress to ai.log. Only append lines to AI.log once they are over a few hours old.
2. Not use abreviations in code except for industry standard
3. Not be over optimistic.
4. Be realistic
5. Use functional programming principles
6. NEVER offer mocked services or mocked data in production code or as options to users. Mocked services and data should ONLY exist in test directories (src/test) for testing purposes.
